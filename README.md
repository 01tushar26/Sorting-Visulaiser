# Sorting-Visulaiser
An interactive web-based application that visually demonstrates sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. This tool combines animations, sound effects, and complexity analysis to provide a fun and educational way to learn algorithm behavior.

# Features

Sorting Algorithms: Supports visualizations for Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.
Dynamic Array Generation: Generate random arrays to observe sorting behavior in action.
Real-Time Visualization: Animates bar comparisons and swaps for better understanding.
Sound Effects: Each bar produces a sound based on its height, offering an auditory experience of sorting.
Complexity Display: Shows time and space complexities of selected algorithms.

# User Controls:

Start and stop sorting.
Mute or unmute sound.
Select algorithms from a dropdown menu.
